üîπ 1) Quick Configuration (with EKS Auto Mode)

    1. AWS automates most of the setup:
        Creates the EKS control plane.
        Provisions worker nodes automatically (using AWS Fargate or managed node groups).
        Sets up networking (VPC, subnets, security groups) for you.
        Installs common add-ons (like VPC CNI, CoreDNS, kube-proxy).

    2. Best for beginners or when you want to get started quickly.

    3. You don‚Äôt have to worry about:
        Node group sizing.
        Picking instance types.
        Setting IAM roles manually.

    4. AWS manages scaling, patching, upgrades in the background (like ‚Äúserverless Kubernetes‚Äù).

    ‚úÖ Use case:
        Developers who just want to run workloads without touching cluster internals.
        POCs, small-to-medium apps, or when you want to save time.        
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:
        Less flexibility. AWS decides infra defaults.
        Costs may be higher if you don‚Äôt optimize.


üîπ 2) Custom Configuration
    
    1. You set up everything manually:
        Choose or create your VPC, subnets, and networking.
        Define node groups (EC2 types, scaling policies, spot vs on-demand).
        Manage IAM roles, security groups, encryption.
        Decide which add-ons to install and configure.

    2. AWS still manages the control plane, but you own the worker nodes and infra.

    ‚úÖ Use case:
        Production clusters where you need full control & customization.
        MNC/enterprise setups with compliance, cost optimization, hybrid/multi-cloud strategies.
        Complex workloads (ML pipelines, multi-tenant apps, strict security).

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:
        Requires deeper Kubernetes + AWS networking knowledge.
        More effort to manage, but also more flexibility.


üîπ Quick Analogy
    Quick Config (Auto Mode) = like renting a fully furnished apartment. Just bring your laptop, and you‚Äôre good.
    Custom Config = like building your own house. More work, but you control every detail.
