🐳 Docker Hub — Use When:
    You need public base images (Node.js, Nginx, Redis, etc.).
    You’re working on open-source projects that others will pull.
    Development or prototyping (quick image sharing across devs).
    CI/CD pipelines that don’t rely only on AWS.
    Cost-sensitive for small projects (free tier works for public images).


☁️ Amazon ECR — Use When:
    You’re deploying production apps on AWS (ECS, EKS, Lambda).
    You need private, secure image storage with IAM integration.
    You want low-latency pulls inside AWS regions (faster deployments).
    You want lifecycle policies to clean old images and save cost.
    Enterprise use cases where security, compliance, and scalability matter.


🚀 Quick Rule of Thumb
    Base images & dev → Docker Hub.
    Production on AWS → ECR.
    Hybrid approach (most common):
        Pull base image from Docker Hub (e.g., node:20-alpine).
        Build your app image → Push to ECR → Deploy with ECS/EKS.
