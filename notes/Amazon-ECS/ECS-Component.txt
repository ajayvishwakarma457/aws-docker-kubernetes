    1. What is AWS ECS?
        Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS. 
        It lets you run Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances or on AWS Fargate (serverless compute for containers). ECS helps manage scaling, networking, load balancing, and availability of your containerized applications.


    2. Key Components of ECS

        a. Cluster
            A logical grouping of resources (EC2 instances or Fargate).
            Think of it as the pool of compute resources where your containers run.
            You can have multiple services and tasks inside a cluster.

        b. Task Definition
            A blueprint for your application.
            Defines which Docker image(s) to run, CPU/memory requirements, environment variables, networking, and storage.
            Can include multiple containers per task (e.g., app container + sidecar logging container).


        c. Task
            A running instance of a task definition.
            If you want one copy of your app running, you launch one task.
            If you need five copies for scaling, you launch five tasks.


        d. Service 
            Ensures that a certain number of tasks are always running.
            Handles scaling (auto or manual).
            Integrates with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB/ALB/NLB) for traffic distribution.
            Example: A web service that ensures 3 tasks (containers) are always active.


        e. Container Agent 
            Runs on each EC2 instance in your ECS cluster (not needed for Fargate).
            Communicates with the ECS control plane.
            Ensures the containers (tasks) are started/stopped as instructed.

        
        f. Scheduling
            ECS has schedulers to place containers across your cluster:
                Service scheduler: maintains the desired task count.
                Custom scheduler: you can define your own logic.
                Daemon scheduling: run one task on every node (useful for logging or monitoring agents).


        g. Launch Types
            EC2 Launch Type: You manage the underlying EC2 instances where tasks run.
            Fargate Launch Type: AWS manages the infrastructure, you just pay for the CPU/memory you request.


        h. Networking
            ECS tasks can run inside a VPC.
            Supports AWS VPC networking mode (awsvpc) → each task gets its own ENI (Elastic Network Interface).
            Security groups and IAM roles can be attached at the task level.

        
        i. IAM Roles
            Task Role: Assign permissions to tasks (e.g., access S3, DynamoDB).
            Execution Role: Used by ECS to pull container images and publish logs.

        
        j. ECS with Other AWS Services
            ECR (Elastic Container Registry) → Store and pull your Docker images.
            CloudWatch Logs & Metrics → Monitor and log containers.
            ALB/NLB → Distribute traffic across tasks.
            Auto Scaling → Scale services up/down based on load.


        3. ECS Deployment Models
            Rolling update: Replace old tasks with new ones gradually.
            Blue/Green deployment (via CodeDeploy): Run new version alongside old, then switch traffic.
            Canary deployments: Send small % of traffic to new version before full rollout.


    ✅ In short:
        Cluster = pool of compute.
        Task Definition = app blueprint.
        Task = running container(s).
        Service = keeps tasks running & scalable.
        Launch Type = EC2 (you manage infra) vs Fargate (AWS manages infra).
