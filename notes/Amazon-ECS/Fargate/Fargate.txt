ðŸ”¹ Steps to Deploy ECR Image to ECS (Fargate)

    1. Create an ECS Cluster
        Go to ECS console â†’ Clusters â†’ Create cluster.
        Choose Networking only (powered by AWS Fargate).
        Name it: my-node-cluster.
        Click Create.


    2. Create a Task Definition
        A Task Definition is like a blueprint for your container.
            Go to ECS â†’ Task Definitions â†’ Create new task definition.
            Choose Fargate launch type.
            Fill in details:
                Task definition name: my-node-task.
                Task role: leave default (unless app needs S3/DynamoDB access).
                CPU & Memory: e.g., 0.25 vCPU, 512 MB.
            Add container:
                Container name: my-node-container.
                Image URI:
                    934445953316.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-node-app:latest
                Port mappings: 3000 (your app listens on port 3000).
            Save the Task Definition.


    3. Create a Service
        A Service runs and maintains your tasks (and can scale them).
            Go to ECS â†’ Clusters â†’ my-node-cluster â†’ Create service.
            Launch type: Fargate.
            Service name: my-node-service.
            Task definition: select my-node-task:1.
            Number of tasks: 1 (start with one container).
            Networking:
                Choose a VPC and subnets.
                Assign a public IP (ENABLED) if you want to access from internet.
            (Optional) Attach a Load Balancer:
                If you want a public URL, select Application Load Balancer.
                Create a new ALB â†’ map it to port 80 â†’ forward to your container port 3000.
             Click Create Service.   
    
    4. Verify Deployment

        Once running, go to ECS â†’ my-node-cluster â†’ Tasks.
        Find your running task â†’ check Public IP.
        Open in browser:
            http://<public-ip>:3000
