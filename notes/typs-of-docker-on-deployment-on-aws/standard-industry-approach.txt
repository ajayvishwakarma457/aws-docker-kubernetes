In practice, the industry-standard approaches for deploying a Node.js app in Docker on AWS usually fall into a few clear categories, depending on company size, scale, and maturity:

🔹 1. Amazon ECS with Fargate (Most Common for Containers)
    Why used:
        No servers/EC2 to manage.
        Pay only for container runtime.
        Easy integration with AWS networking, autoscaling, and monitoring.
    Adoption: Very widely used in mid-to-large companies.
    Use case: Standard for microservices and containerized apps without the complexity of Kubernetes.


🔹 2. Amazon EKS (Kubernetes, Enterprise Standard)    
    Why used:
        Industry loves Kubernetes (multi-cloud portability, vendor-neutral).
        Rich ecosystem (service mesh, CI/CD, GitOps, Helm, etc.).
        Ideal for complex/microservice-heavy workloads.
    Adoption: Standard in large enterprises and startups who are already invested in Kubernetes.
    Use case: Teams that want Kubernetes as a company-wide strategy, not just AWS.


🔹 3. Elastic Beanstalk (Legacy but Still Common)
    Why used:
        Easy for small teams.
        Minimal infra management.
    Adoption: Often used by startups or MVPs; many companies migrate later to ECS/EKS.
    Use case: Quick deployments, not much infra experience required.

🔹 4. App Runner (New but Growing Fast)
    Why used:
        Simplifies deployment even more than ECS Fargate.
        Competes with Heroku/Netlify-style DX.
    Adoption: Increasing among teams who want AWS-managed experience without full container orchestration overhead.


🚀 Industry Consensus
    ECS Fargate → the default standard for most AWS-based containerized Node.js apps.
    EKS (Kubernetes) → the enterprise/multi-cloud standard.
    App Runner → the new trend for simpler deployments (especially startups).

👉 In short:
    If you ask “what do most professional teams use?” → ECS on Fargate.
    If you ask “what do big enterprises with lots of microservices use?” → EKS (Kubernetes).
