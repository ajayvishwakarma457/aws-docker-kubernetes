1. Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS, Simple)

    Deploy Dockerized Node.js directly.
    Beanstalk provisions EC2, load balancer, scaling automatically.
    Easiest "managed" way (less infra setup).
    Supports single Docker container or multi-container with docker-compose.


2. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
    Orchestrates Docker containers.
    Two launch types:
        ECS on EC2 → you manage EC2 instances where containers run.
        ECS on Fargate → serverless containers (no EC2 to manage).
    Works well with ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for storing Docker images.


3. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
    Managed Kubernetes service.
    Deploy Dockerized Node.js as Kubernetes Pods.
    More complex but gives full Kubernetes ecosystem.
    Best if you need microservices, advanced scaling, service mesh, etc.


4. Amazon EC2 (Do-It-Yourself)
    Provision EC2 VM.
    Install Docker and run your container manually or via scripts.
    Maximum flexibility but least automation.
    Useful for small apps or learning.


5. AWS App Runner
    Simplified service for directly deploying containerized or Node.js apps.
    No need to manage infra or orchestration.
    Similar to Fargate but more "application-level".
    Connects directly with GitHub or ECR.

6. AWS Lambda with Docker Images
    Package Node.js app as a container image (up to 10 GB).
    Deploy to Lambda for event-driven/serverless workloads.
    Good for APIs, microservices, cron jobs.
    Not ideal for full monolithic apps.


7. Amazon Lightsail
    Simple VPS-like service.
    Can run Docker containers on Lightsail instances.
    Good for small-scale, low-cost deployments.
    Easier than raw EC2, but less scalable than ECS/EKS.


✅ Summary:
    Quick/simple → Elastic Beanstalk, App Runner, Lightsail.
    Scalable containers → ECS (Fargate preferred).
    Enterprise/microservices → EKS.
    Custom control → EC2.
    Serverless → Lambda with Docker.
